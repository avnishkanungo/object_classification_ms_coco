# Object Classification with MS COCO Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains code for training and evaluating an object classification model using the MS COCO dataset. The model is trained to classify objects present in images into predefined categories.

## Dataset
The MS COCO (Microsoft Common Objects in Context) dataset is used for training and evaluation. It is a large-scale dataset containing images with annotations for object detection, segmentation, and captioning tasks.

You can download the MS COCO dataset from the official website: [MS COCO Dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#download)
